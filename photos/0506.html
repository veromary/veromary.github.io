<h1>Great Train Weekend</h1>

<p>Peter, Patrick and Christopher visited 
<a http://www.mountvictoria.biz">Mount Victoria</a>
for the great train weekend.  They followed the 3801 up the mountain
and had a ride on a small electric Thomas the Tank Engine.
This little train ride lives at 
<a http://www.thetrainshed.com.au">The Train Shed</a>, Vicary's Winery,
2km south of Luddenham.
