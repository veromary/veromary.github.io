<p>This is my homeschooling webpage.  It paints a picture of our
family's approach to homeschooling.
A related page is my <a href="teaching.html">Teaching resources page</a>
which I started pre-motherhood. There you can find bits and pieces related
to specific areas of learning.  Here more general resources about
homeschooling.</p>

<p>You might also check my <a

<h3>Websites:</h3>

<p>There are lots of web sites about homeschooling out there.
<a href="http://www.love2learn.net">Love2learn</a> is a website of favourite
resources for Catholic homeschoolers based in America.  It is a good start
for browsing the multitude of publishers and curriculum providers in the US.
They also post new links via <a href="http://twitter.com/love2learnhome">twitter</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here in Australia we have the 
<a href="http://www.hea.asn.au">Home Education Association Inc., Australia.</a>
It provides public liability insurance for smaller groups who need insurance
to hire halls and to hold certain activities.
There's also <a href="http://ha-magazine.beverleypaine.com/">Homeschool Australia Newsletter</a>
by Beverley Paine, a great work encouraging practical
day to day learning.

<h3>Bookshops</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cardinalnewman.com.au">Cardinal Newman Faith

This is a great shop with links to Fr. Tierney, author of the Bush
Boys books about homeschooling families in settings not dissimilar to
the Blue Mountains.
There, under downloads, you'll find archives of  <a
href="http://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/Downloads.htm#KEEPING%20IN%20TOUCH">
Keeping In Touch</a> - a quarterly newsletter edited by different homeschooling
families around Australia (though mostly NSW)</p>

<p>
<a
href="http://mustardseed.org.au">Mustard Seed Bookshop</a>
Fantastic shop in Lidcombe, Sydney.  I'm writing this just after their
mid year sale.  They are part of the Catholic Education Office - or
something like that - which has been revitalised since Cardinal Pell
came to Sydney.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://fidelitybooks.com.au">Fidelity Books</a>
an offshoot of the J23 co-op.  Lots of Catholic books.  Based in
Melbourne.

Mason style.
</p>

Traditional Catholic bookshop.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.portico.com.au/">Portico Books</a>
with a beautiful shop right near the historic St. Patrick's Church in
Sydney.  Many beautiful books too, as well as stationery.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.adnilpress.com/">Adnil Press</a>
A Classical Homeschooling publisher and bookshop supplying Australia and
beyond.  They have some home grown Australian history resources.  Probably
the best place for Australian history.  Also stocking Latina Christiana and other
language resources.

<p>Blogs are more personal websites that some families use to share day to
day news and events.  The mailing lists and forums listed above can be a
great starting point for finding more of these websites.  A
homeschooling mother from Hawaii has set up the <a
href="http://chbd.blogspot.com/2006/12/international.html">Catholic
Homeschooling Blog Directory</a> which can help you find other
homeschoolers in your area.
