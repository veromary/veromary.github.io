<a href="{{ site.url }}/music/hymnbook/"><img src="{{ site.url }}/music/hymnbook/angel.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 3px 3px" /></a>In 2013 I started blogging over at [Corpus Christi Watershed](http://www.ccwatershed.org).  This has helped me see that music is important to me.  It has also brought home how many unfinished projects I have lying around the interwebs!

So, I will try to tie things together here.  Things like my version of the <a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2014/sep/6/richard-terrys-hymnal/">Old Westminster Hymnal</a>

Also, [The Hymn to St Mary of the Cross.]({% post_url 2011-07-21-hymn-st-mary %}) A short hymn in Long Meter (88.88).

<p>The two main projects here at brandt Lab:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="epiphany.html">Proclamation of moveable feasts for Epiphany</a></li>
<li><a href="hymnbook/index.html">A New Book of Old Hymns</a></li>
</ul>
