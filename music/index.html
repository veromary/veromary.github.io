<h1>Sheet Music Collection</h1>

<p>
<a href="{{ site.url }}/music/hymnbook/"><img src="{{ site.url }}/music/hymnbook/angel.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 3px 3px" /></a>Music both inspires us and drives us crazy.</p>

<p>In 2013 I started blogging over at <a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org">Corpus Christi Watershed</a>.  This has helped me see that music is important to me.  It has also brought home how many unfinished projects I have lying around the interwebs!</p>

<p>So, I will try to tie things together here.  Things like my version of the <a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2014/sep/6/richard-terrys-hymnal/">Old Westminster Hymnal</a></p>

<p>Also, <a href="stmary.html">The Hymn to St Mary of the Cross.</a> A short hymn in Long Meter (88.88).</p>

<p>The two main projects here at brandt Lab:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="epiphany.html">Proclamation of moveable feasts for Epiphany</a></li>
<li><a href="hymnbook/index.html">A New Book of Old Hymns</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of this is gregorian chant typest using OpusTeX.
<a href="http://home.gna.org/gregorio">Gregorio</a>
is developing into a fine alternative.
OpusTeX is old, difficult to use, but its free and it works.
Gregorio is new, easier to use, more completely free and
it is under active development, so if you do come across a bug
you can tell someone and get it fixed.  In about ten years time, 
when my children are more grown up, I hope to use it a lot.

Other programs I use for modern music notation are MusiXTeX,
PMX and M-Tx.  These are featured in the 
<a href="http://icking-music-archive.org">Werner Icking Music Archive</a>.  
Recently I tried using 
<a href="http://www.lilypond.org">Lilypond</a>.  I was pleasantly
surprised by how much more sophisticated it is.  I've used it to
type up some classical guitar music.  The Lilypond fonts are also
a little more handsome than most.</p>

<p>Those are all TeX based programs.  All require source files edited
with a text editor (I used  to use Emacs, now using Vim).  Its an old fashioned way to
prepare printable documents, but it works!</p>

<a name="jubilate"><h2>Jubilate Deo</h2></a>

<p>In 1974 Pope Paul VI issued a little booklet called Jubilate Deo.
It gave a minimum repertoire of Gregorian Chant to be used
throughout the world.  It keeps things really simple.</p>

<p>Using the margin notes capabilities of LaTeX I've tried a 
different way of laying out the page with the latin text in 
the main section and english in the wide margins.  The pages are
a4.  You can see the progress so far in <a href="jubilate.pdf">jubilate.pdf</a>
and for the TeXnicians here is the source 
<a href="jubilate.tar.gz">jubilate.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<a name="rosary"><h2>Rosary in Latin</h2></a>

<p>A little card for saying the rosary in latin.
The chant for the Pater Noster and the Salve Regina is included.
It doesn't have the English translations.
Have a look at <a href="rosary.pdf">rosary.pdf</a> and for the
TeXnicians <a href="rosary.tar.gz">rosary.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<a name="dead"><h2>Mass of the Dead</h2></a>

<p>A mass booklet for a funeral.  Needs some work, but its almost there.
Chant for all the propers and ordinary done.  
Also includes the parts of the Mass.  34 pages
<a href="dead.pdf">dead.pdf</a> and <a href="dead.tar.gz">dead.tar.gz</a>
</p>

<a name="misc"><h2>Miscellaneous Pieces</h2></a>

<p>I had an informal guitar/recorder/singing class that I arranged music for.
The songs are usually very simple with diagrammed chords for the guitars.</p>

<ul>
<li>Silent Night: <a href="silent.pdf">silent.pdf</a> Two voices plus guitar chords with <a href="silent.mtx">MTx source</a></li>
</ul>
