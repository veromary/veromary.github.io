Living the Truth
================

C P Bowler wrote a series of booklets aimed at high school students in New Zealand.

They make an awesome introduction to Thomistic Philosophy and general Catholic teaching.

Each week I'm endeavouring to make up a worksheet with Exercise A of each chapter.  The last page of each pdf has the answers.

I'm not sure of the copyright of the booklets.  A teacher has scanned in and converted the entire series to word doc files, one for each chapter.  I will try see about permission to make that available here.
