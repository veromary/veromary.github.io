\noindent Name:

\noindent {\Large Chapter XLVI -- The Eucharist}



1. Christ said “I am the \spaces{7} of life.” 

2. Again: “The \spaces{7}  that  I
will give is My \spaces{7} for the \spaces{7} of the world.” 

3. The  Jews  said:
“How can this man give us his flesh to \spaces{7}?” 

4. Christ replied:  “Amen,
amen I say unto you, except you eat the \spaces{7}  of  the  Son  of  Man  and
drink His \spaces{7}, you shall not have \spaces{7} in you.” 

5.  Again:  For  My
flesh is meat \spaces{7} and My Blood  is  drink  \spaces{7}.”  

6.  Peter  said:
“Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of  \spaces{7};  and  we  have
believed and have known that  Thou  art  the  \spaces{7},  the  \spaces{7}.” 

7. 
Christ fulfilled His promise at the \spaces{7}. 

8. He  said  over  the  bread:
“This \spaces{7},” and over the wine: “This \spaces{7}.” 

9. He was  then  making
His last \spaces{7}, and also imposing a \spaces{7}. 

10.  St.  Paul  blamed  his
converts for not discerning in the Eucharist “the  \spaces{7}  of  the  Lord.”


11. The letters in “ikthos” are the initial letters  of  Our  Lord's  title,
\spaces{7}. 

12. This word was used to  comply  with  the  “Discipline  of  the
\spaces{7}. 

13. All heretics who broke away during the  first  thousand  years
(believed) (rejected) the doctrine of the Real Presence. 

14.  All  realities
are either substances or \spaces{7}. 

15. The words of consecration change  the
(substance) (accidents) of the bread and wine. 

16.  This  change  is  called
\spaces{7}. 

17. The words of  consecration  change  the  (matter  only)  (form
only) (matter and form) of the  bread  and  wine.  

18.  God  (can)  \spaces{7}
change a creature into Himself. 

19. God (can) \spaces{7}  instantly  change  a
monkey into an angel. 

20. After the consecration, God keeps the \spaces{7}  of
the bread and wine in being, and the other accidents exist in  it.  

21.  The
words of  consecration  put  only  \spaces{7}  of  Christ  present  under  the
appearances of the bread; but  the  rest  of  Our  Lord  is  also  there  by
\spaces{7}. 

22. Christ (has) (has not) His natural stature in  the  Host. 

23. 
He (is) \spaces{7} wholly present in every part of the Host. 

24. He  (is)  (is
not) present circumscriptively in the Eucharist. 

25. There,  He  (has)  (has
not) physical contact with things about Him. 

26. It (is)  (is  not)  correct
to say that He comes down from heaven to the altar. 

27. In the Eucharist  He
(is) \spaces{7} distant from Himself in heaven. 

28. The special effect of  the
Eucharist is to increase one of  the  supernatural  virtues.  Which  is  it?
\spaces{7}. 

29. With  it,  it  increases  the  Gifts  which  give  us  infused
\spaces{7}. 

30. The Eucharist is an infinitely precious treasure,  because  it
is \spaces{7} under the appearances of bread and wine.
