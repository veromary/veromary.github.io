 <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<p>
In April 2012 the brandt Lab went all Wordpress-y.  Now, October 2013, I'm having a go at migrating those posts back over into a Jekyll-y static site.  The mastitis post above is still the most popular article, followed by  how to use hotpotatoes in Wordpress. It still seems a bit odd to convert that one over to static.
</p>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
