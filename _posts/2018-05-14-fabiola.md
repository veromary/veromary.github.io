title: Fabiola - a Tale of the Catacombs

A legendary book that I was overjoyed to find in an Op Shop way back in 2001 (before kids). Something about pre-natal check-ups and waiting rooms meant that I read a lot of books that year.

The book brings to life the story of Sts Agnes, Sebastian, Tarcisius and Pancratius and a few others for good measure. The author drew on his own familiarity with the Catacombs of Rome and then current research (1850s).

It has been adapted into a movie or two - [an Italian silent movie from 1918](https://youtu.be/CLjO1omzsCg) and a later [Franco Italian movie from 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabiola_(1949_film)).

It is available on [Librivox](https://librivox.org/fabiola-or-the-church-of-the-catacombs-by-cardinal-nicholas-patrick-wiseman/), but not yet Project Gutenberg.

And I have just made a [cheap paperback reprint](http://www.lulu.com/shop/cardinal-wiseman/fabiola-a-tale-of-the-catacombs/paperback/product-23643093.html) through Lulu.
