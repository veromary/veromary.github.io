A legendary book that I was overjoyed to find in an Op Shop way back in 2001 (before kids). Something about pre-natal check-ups and waiting rooms meant that I read a lot of books that year.

<a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/cardinal-wiseman/fabiola-a-tale-of-the-catacombs/paperback/product-23643093.html"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/fabiola300.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em"></a>
The book brings to life the story of Sts Agnes, Sebastian, Tarcisius and Pancratius and a few others for good measure. The author drew on his own familiarity with the Catacombs of Rome and then current research (1850s).

It has been adapted into a movie or two - [an Italian silent movie from 1918](https://youtu.be/CLjO1omzsCg) and a later [Franco Italian movie from 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabiola_(1949_film)).

It is available on [Librivox](https://librivox.org/fabiola-or-the-church-of-the-catacombs-by-cardinal-nicholas-patrick-wiseman/), but not yet Project Gutenberg. It's sitting in the Post Processing round with the Distributed Proofreaders.


And I have just made a [cheap paperback reprint](http://www.lulu.com/shop/cardinal-wiseman/fabiola-a-tale-of-the-catacombs/paperback/product-23643093.html) through Lulu.

My Op Shop copy is falling apart (and it's only from 1962!) so I'm really looking forward to this new reprint that I can hand to my kids without worrying about losing the pages.

There were a few spin off novels - not by the same author. Callista by Cardinal Newman and I also have a book about Perpetua and Felicity called Fabiola's Sisters. The time affects the style, so they start off feeling a tad melodramatic, but you become acclimatized after a while.

And to show I've been interested in formatting Fabiola for over a decade, [here is my earlier attempt]({{ site.url }}/fabiola/index.html) to scan, ocr and format the book. I only got a few chapters in.
