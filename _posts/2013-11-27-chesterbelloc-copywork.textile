Here are some ideas for copywork from Project Gutenberg.  Each link takes you to the ebook page.  The HTML format is good for cutting and pasting into a word processor (like OpenOffice Writer or Microsoft Word).  Then change the font to something suitable to trace, like "Jarman":http://www.fontspace.com/christopher-jarman or "Briem":http://briem.net
