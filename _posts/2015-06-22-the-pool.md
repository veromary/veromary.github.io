To celebrate my birthday Peter showed us the way to the lengendary Woodford Pool, also known as Paradise Beach.  It is located in a little crook of the creek south of Woodford Dam.

We walked from Woodford Rd, not far from the free tennis courts.  The first part is along fire tracks.  Then the path splits off along less and less well maintained tracks with little markers - a cairn of rocks at one point and plastic ribbons at another.

It is well worth the walk!

But the water is icy!

There are two rope swings but it was not the day to try them out.
