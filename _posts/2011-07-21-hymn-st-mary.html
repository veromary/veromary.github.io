A hymn to the first saint of Australia in a simple traditional metrical style.  St Mary of the Cross is commonly known by her name before religion - Mary MacKillop.  Start singing it now to prepare for her feast on the 8th August.

<p>
O Mother Mary of the Cross<br>
The first Australian saint, we hail.<br>
Thy work to lead the poor to truth<br>
Awaking mercy in thy trail.
</p>
<p>
Thou ever soughtest Joseph's aid,<br>
Strong in the faith that he would be<br>
An advocate to that dear Heart<br>
That bled and died upon the Tree.
</p>
<p>
The Tree of life, the Cross of death<br>
To which thy name and life were bound,<br>
The paradox that pain and strife<br>
To everlasting joy redound.
</p>
<p>
O Mary! intercede for us<br>
And form us to His holy Will<br>
With Father and the Holy Ghost<br>
And Heart of Jesus burning still.
</p>

Any Long Meter tune will do.  I've picked Rockingham since it's new-ish to me.  When I was nutting out the words I had the tune for Creator Alme Siderum in my head.
