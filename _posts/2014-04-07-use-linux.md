To be fair, this post is more to start a Computers category so that my old post on hotpotatoes in wordpress has a better home.

But, if I can give one piece of advice for all your computing aspirations, it probably would be to Use Linux.

In the "Real World" this advice should be taken with a grain of salt, as Linux will drive you crazy.

The good points:

 * It's Educational
 * It's Free
 * The world would be a Better Place if more people used Linux
 * It can do anything (probably with a large quantity of hacking)
 * People will look up to you (or think you're crazy, but you can't please everyone)

The bad points:

 * You have to learn stuff to use it
 * No one has a monetary interest in helping you out
 * Not very many people use Linux
 * Just about everything requires some hacking
 * People will think you're crazy

but the best things in life are free, and being different has it's advantages.
