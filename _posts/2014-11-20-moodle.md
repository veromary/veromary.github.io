A few years ago I tried installing [Moodle](http://www.moodle.org) on my shared web hosting only to find out that you need more than regular shared hosting to run Moodle.

The other way was to run one of our at home computers as a web server.

Advantages

* Private
* Fast
* Doesn't add to monthly bandwidth allowances
* Totally customizable

Disadvantages

* I can't share it and show it off to the world at large.

So, [here is the link](http://aeolus.local) as requested by a son.  This will only work at our place.

Short list of how to do this at home:

* Install a LAMP/WAMP
* Install Moodle
* Install avahi if you're using Linux or Apple Bonjour thingy if you're using Windows

Perhaps I can upload completed courses for other people to install on their own home moodles.  Perhaps I can even help install moodle for homeschoolers in my area.  Perhaps this could be the start of our own little homeschool course repository.
