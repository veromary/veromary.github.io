<h2>Books</h2>

There are a few books I've printed out from texts available on the internet.
The smaller books are easily stapled into one signature, larger books are 
glued to simulate perfect binding.  They are printed on regular 80gsm
copy paper on a laser printer, so they'll last.

Here's the list:

<ul>
<li>A Brief History of England by G.K. Chesterton</li>
<li>Calvary and the Mass: a missal companion, by F.J. Sheen</li>
<li>Memoir of Father (Saint) Vincent de Paul</li>
<li>Around the world with the Trapp Family (without pictures), Maria von Trapp</li>
<li>St. Thomas Aquinas by G. K. Chesterton</li>
</ul>

If you find a certain book you'd like through <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">Project Gutenberg</a> or the <a href="http://www.ewtn.com">EWTN</a> library,
or any other source of text files, I might be able to print it for you.
